        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">Seek, Sort, & Select is not a cookie-cutter workshop or webinar.</p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
          <span class="utility_classes__strong">This Series centers around creating and promoting a stellar dating profile that attracts the type of men you're looking for online.</span> It's built around a customized dating plan, personalized course materials, one-on-one coaching, and real-time feedback and support. It's a personal journey of transformation with a single goal: giving you the skills & techniques you need to find your ideal compatible partner. 
        </p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">Everything you'll experience in this Series will be specifically tailored to <span class="utility_classes__emphasis">you</span>: your story, your struggles, your needs, your unique character traits, your new life after divorce, your search for lasting love.</p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer"> 
          We'll steer you towards the dating sites that are right for you, work with you to craft a winning profile, teach you how to identify & approach compatible men, help you avoid the players and weirdos, and be your personal "Wing Woman" before, during, and after dates. We'll teach you how to become a confident, conscious dater who genuinely enjoys dating. We'll show you simple but highly effective techniques you can use to make compatible partners feel important and appreciated, techniques that will help you build a strong foundation for your next forever-after relationship. 
        </p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
          By the end of this Series, you'll have everything you need to seek, sort, and select compatible partners online. You'll know how to get in front of men you actually want to meet. You'll have a system in place that lets you spend less time searching for men online and more time offline, getting to know great guys face-to-face. You'll experience, maybe for the first time, what it's like to accurately and confidently predict your romantic future.

          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">This Series is delivered over the course of six weeks through six one-on-one, hour-long coaching sessions.</p>
          <p class="utility_classes__center" slot="pitch_card_answer">These sessions are conducted over the phone.
          </p>
        
          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            Your first two coaching sessions are focused on the most important piece of dating real estate you own: <span class="utility_classes__strong">your online dating profile</span>.
          </p>
        
          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            If you're new to online dating, we'll identify the right dating site for you and work with you, step-by-step, to create a winning profile that captures your strengths, separates you from the crowd, attracts compatible men, and gets you great dates. If you're already online dating, we'll do a complete profile makeover. We'll also teach you how to avoid the mistakes made by 90% of online daters. 
          </p>
        
          <p slot="pitch_card_answer" class="utility_classes__strong">

          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            In your remaining four coaching sessions, we'll log onto your dating site and work with you, in real-time, as you begin to seek, sort, and select authentic men online. 
          </p>

          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            This is by the far the most valuable part of this Series! No more second-guessing yourself or feeling overwhelmed, lost, and alone in front of your computer screen. You'll have a Certified Dating & Relationship Coach "sitting" right beside you as you search the site, screen matches for compatibility, message potential matches, and set up first dates. 
          </p>          

          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            Between sessions, you'll receive unlimited e-mail support & coaching. Need help coming up with a great opening line, conversation starter, or flirty email that gets a guy's attention? No problem! We've got your back. Need help deciphering an online match's mixed messages or confusing responses? E-mail us and we'll get to the bottom of things together.

          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            <a href="https://coachfederation.org/research/global-coaching-study" target="_blank">One recent survey</a> by the <a href="https://coachfederation.org/" target="_blank">International Coach Federation</a>, the gold-standard accrediting body for coaches, found that top-tier coaches were charging anywhere from $375 to $607 per hour for their services!

          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            <span class="utility_classes__strong">We understand that financial uncertainty is an unavoidable part of life for many divorced women</span>. We're also aware there's no shortage of shady businesses out there that prey on the fears, anxieties, and dreams of single ladies.  
          </p>
          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            Because Compatible Connections is committed to helping all women find the love of their lives after divorce, <span class="utility_classes__strong">we've deliberately under priced our services</span>. We've built our business around the idea that any woman re-building their life after divorce should be able to afford our services. We believe in putting the needs of prospective clients, not profits, first.  
          </p>
          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            <span class="utility_classes__strong">Our standard rate for coaching services is $125.00 per hour, which puts the total cost to enroll in our {pageService} Signature Series at $750.00</span>. If that seems like a lot of money upfront, don't worry! We offer flexible payment plans. We also offer our clients a no-questions-asked, money-back guarantee if they're not dating differently by the end of their first coaching session!
          </p>
          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            Every divorced woman knows in her bones that choosing the wrong partner can be a costly mistake. If you're ready to date and want to do things right the second time around, we'd urge you to consider this Series a worthwhile investment in yourself. We offer divorced women something no other coaching firm out there can: a chance to learn everything you need to overcome past mistakes and find real lasting love.
