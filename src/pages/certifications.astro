            <p>
              Professional Coaching has grown exponentially over the past few decades!
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a niche industry back in the '90s has become <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-leader-as-coach" target="_blank">an integral part of many businesses</a>, as well as a transformative part of people's <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-benefits-of-a-coaching-culture/" target="_blank">professional</a>, financial, personal, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dating-coaches-help-successful-women-find-love-2018-9" target="_blank">romantic</a> lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's never been easier to find a coach to help you advance your career, take control of your finances, overcome your limiting beliefs, or find love. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, it's never been easier to become a coach, too. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The truth is Coaching is a largely unregulated industry. That means <a href="https://inc.com/gene-hammett/everything-you-know-about-personal-development-is-probably-wrong-heres-how-to-fix-it.html" target="_blank">almost anyone can call themselves a "Coach"</a> and charge clients whatever they want for their services. 
            </p>
            <p>
              All too often, that ends up being a substantial amount of money, especially for recently divorced women! 
            </p>

       <SectionGray id="certifications__2_mixed_feelings">
          <div class="flexbox__basic_column">
            <p>
              I've been a full-time Coach since 1995 and watched the rise of the Coaching industry with mixed feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the one hand, I think a new helping profession is a welcome development: the more people we have out there working to improve people's lives the better.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, I know from personal experience that unscrupulous and inexperienced coaches have damaged Coaching's reputation and credibility in the eyes of many people.
            </p>
            <p>
              From time to time, I see that damage reflected in the eyes of the people I meet when I tell them I'm a Dating & Relationship Coach, and it breaks my heart!
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why I've devoted a section of Compatible Connection's website to educating potential clients, divorce professionals, and other visitors about my credentials.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are good coaches out there, and I like to think I'm one of them, but I understand, for better or worse, the burden is on me to assure people I'm worthy of their time, trust, and attention.

            <p>
              A good coach can change a life: but how can you tell a good coach from a bad one?
            </p>
            <p>
              There's no quick and easy answer to this question...but there <em>are</em> things women can do to maximize their chances of working with a qualified coach. 
            </p>
            <p class="utility_classes__strong">
              The first thing you absolutely need to do before hiring a coach is research their credentials.  
            </p>
            <p>
              My Coaching certifications, for example, were awarded through the <a href="https://coachingfederation.org/" target="_blank">International Coaching Federation ("ICF")</a> and <a href="https://www.coachu.com/home/" target="_blank">Coach U</a>. 
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
       </SectionGray>
       <SectionGray id="certifications__4_icf">
        <div class="flexbox__basic_column">
            <p>
              The ICF is is one of the world's oldest and largest professional Coaching organizations. 
            </p>
            <img src="/assets/images/certifications-icf.png" alt="The International Coaching Federation's logo." id="certifications__icf" loading="lazy">
            <p>
              In addition to partnering with universities (such as <a href="https://learnmore.rutgers.edu/leadership-certification/" target="_blank">Rutgers</a>) to integrate coaching accredition into their existing curricula, they also offer <a href="https://coachingfederation.org/credentials-and-standards" target="_blank">three different levels of certification</a> to private Coach practitioners.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The most advanced level of certification offered by the ICF is the <a href="https://coachingfederation.org/credentials-and-standards/mcc-path" target="_blank">Master Certified Coach ("MCC") credential</a>, which I currently hold. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Getting your MCC is not something you can do over the course of a weekend-long retreat! In to order to qualify for an MCC credential, Coaches must first:  
            </p>
            <CertRequirements id="mcc" certification="MCC">
              <li slot="requirement">

                Log a <span class="utility_classes__emphasis">minimum</span> of 2500 hours of
                client work, 2200 of which has to be with paying clients;

              Coach U is one of the Coaching industry's founding organizations.

            <img src="/assets/images/certifications-coach_u-2.png" alt="Coach U's logo." id="certifications__coach_u" loading="lazy">
            <p>
              They've been developing certification standards and training accredited coaches since the early '90s. In fact, Coach U has been around so long that several Coach U graduates launched the ICF in 1994!  
            </p>
            <p>
              I received my Certified Coach credential from Coach U in 1998. What I learned through Coach U has been invaluable to my Coaching practice. Not only did Coach U provide me with a strong foundation for my client work, it also provided me with a wealth of licensed coaching tools & methodologies (such as their Tru Values Program) I've customized to meet the needs of women dating after divorce. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Coach U's standards for awarding their Certified Coach credential are just as rigorous as the ICF's standards for awarding their MCC credential.  
            </p>

            The second thing you absolutely need to do before hiring a coach is interview them!

            Now it's time to interview some Coaches!
          </p>
          <p>
            It may feel a bit strange or uncomfortable to approach a total stranger, but don't worry! Any reputable coach will always welcome the opportunity to speak with prospective clients and answer their questions. Results-driven coaching is about building a transformative relationship with your clients. That's almost impossible to do if a coach and a client aren't a good fit for each other. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If you've never worked with a Coach before, you may not know what questions to ask during your interview. Here are some basic "must ask" questions to help you get the most out of your conversation as a prospective client:

                Ask them to share at least two or three references.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If they're not willing to share references with you, move
                    on!

                working with a Coach.

              <ul>

                  Clearly state what you hope to accomplish working with a
                  Coach. (See above.)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ask them to explain how they think they're uniquely
                  positioned as a Coach to help you accomplish those goals.
