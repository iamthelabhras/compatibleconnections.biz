            What Is Coaching?
          </h2>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">Coaching is not counseling.</p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">Coaches do not "diagnose" clients' problems or tell people what they need to do to "get better". Coaches believe that nobody understands you better than yourself and that, in a very real way, you already "know" the answers to your questions and the solutions to your problems.</p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">Coaches believe that their role in the coach-client relationship is to help clients uncover these answers and solutions. To facilitate this process of discovery, coaches are trained to ask empowering, transformational questions that help clients create solutions, generate new ideas and insights, and overcome their life's greatest challenges. They're also trained to be great listeners whose focus is always on what makes each individual client unique. </p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">Coaching is about helping people unlock their own potential and realize their life's possibilities! </p>

            What Happens During A <span class="utility_classes__clean_break_on_wrap">One-On-One</span> Coaching Session?
          </h2>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">That's completely up to you!</p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">Because Coaching Sessions center around each client's unique needs, Sessions aren't rigid or formula driven. This is not a one-size-fits-all service!</p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">That said, clients usually come to a Coaching Session with at least one specific question, problem, or situation they'd like to talk about or explore. For example, past clients have used their Session to discover what it is about them that attracts compatible men, tackle online dating anxiety, and clarify the character traits they should be looking for in the men they date.</p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">Whatever it is you want to address, you'll be surprised how much you can learn in just 60 minutes with a trained and experienced Coach!</p>
        <p slot="pitch_card_answer">All of our clients receive additional support after their Coaching Session in the form of e-mail follow ups, as well as additional resources & educational materials.</p>

            with clients and pass a comprehensive & rigorous examination.

          <p slot="pitch_card_answer">
            This certification process usually takes about two years to complete.

            Life after divorce is complicated. There's so much to do - putting yourself
            back together, creating a whole new normal, opening yourself to the idea of
            starting over with someone new, taking "the plunge" and giving online dating a
            try - and it can all seem overwhelming. Coaching is a support system that can
            help you manage those feelings and rediscover the joy of being single.
