            <p slot="rave_text">
              Men tell me all the time how "different" I seem to be and how open and easy it is to talk with me! Connecting with guys that see the world the way you do makes it so much easier to take things to the next level.

              The dating skills I've learned through her Partner With Yourself Signature Series really work! Not only has my dating life improved, I also have greater awareness of who I am and what I want/need in a life partner. Bernadette's style is authentic, caring, and results-oriented - which is a breath of fresh air. I chose Bernadette as my dating expert because her techniques work instantly. She is committed to helping her clients master the crazy dating scene. I strongly believe Bernadette is a leader in the dating industry. Her skills and strategies are revolutionary, and I have personally experienced a dating transformation. I highly recommend Bernadette to anyone who is single and wants to master the inner game of dating and relationships. Since being coached by Bernadette I have transformed my entire love life! What more could I ask for?

              It's not just about what to wear, where to go, who pays in this brave world of internet match-ups its getting over your reluctance to take a stab at it. It seemed so difficult for me but then I stumbled upon Compatible Connections and took advantage of a free Discovery Session. So impressed and inspired by Bernadette, I signed up on the spot for 6 Weeks! My personal experience transformed my entire life, outlook, and feeling on being single. Bernadette comes from authenticity, honesty and personal experience as a divorcee. She can help you find your new normal with your second chapter of life and love.

              These new ideas and savvy ways to screen men without them even 'noticing' are brilliant! I now have a million new ideas to find a companion and 'qualify' them before I leave the house. Bernadette is brilliant and original!

              And I owe it all to my work with Bernadette who showed me how to jump back into dating after divorce. My second chapter is self-written and speaks to exactly who I am and what I most want in a new relationship. I'm having a blast and meeting men that I would have never even noticed before!

              It's always nice to have company on the weekends and chats during the work week, but what I realized while working with Bernadette is that we are NOT on the same 'relationship page.' I wanted to someday be married and he was perfectly content being a confirmed bachelor! No more wasting time and no more settling. Thanks again! NEXT!

              Never in a million years would I believe I had "it" all the time! Plain and simple...get to know your personality and what makes you tick so you can keep yourself out of the way while going for the man of your dreams! Yes, we all do self-sabotage and lose out on some relationships we wish we hadn't lost. Never again!
